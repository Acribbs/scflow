CGAT-sc documentation!
======================

CGAT-sc is a collection of single cell pipelines that allow users to perform some of the standard workflows
associated wit single cell analysis. This repository is still in development but the aim is to collate a
series of single cell workflows that allow the 

The workflow management systems that underpins all of our pipelines is `CGAT-core <>https://github.com/cgat-developers/cgat-core>`_.
We demonstrate the functionality of CGAT-core using a simple RNA-seq pipeline in `cgat-showcase <https://github.com/cgat-developers/cgat-showcase>`_.
Therefore, if you are not familiar with how we build our workflows I suggest that you look at these two pipelines first.
